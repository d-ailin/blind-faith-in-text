The report by the BfV cited knowledge gaps and noted several points that would make the success of any legal undertaking to ban Scientology doubtful . First , the BfV report stated there was no evidence that Scientology could be viewed as a foreign organization ; there were German churches and missions , a German board , German bylaws , and no evidence that the organization was \" totally remote @-@ controlled \" from the United States . A foreign organization would have been much easier to ban than a German one . The second argument on which those proposing the ban had counted was Scientology 's aggressive opposition to the constitution .

The BfV also considered whether there were grounds to act against the Church of Scientology on the basis that they were practising medicine without a licence , but expressed doubts that a court would accept this reasoning . \n\n----------\nIs the tree dead?

During this period , defences in Australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery , based on garrisoned coastal forts . However , by the 1890s , improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led Major General James Edwards \u2014 who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces \u2014 to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid mobilisation of brigades of infantry . As a consequence he called for a restructure of defences , and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies . Edwards argued for the colonial forces to be federated and for professional units \u2014 obliged to serve anywhere in the South Pacific \u2014 to replace the volunteer forces . These views found support in the influential New South Wales Commandant , Major General Edward Hutton , however suspicions held by the smaller colonies towards New South Wales and Victoria stifled the proposal . These reforms remaining unresolved however , and defence issues were generally given little attention in the debate on the political federation of the colonies . \n\n----------\nIs there a TV?

The colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890 , and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs , the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia . To do this , they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces . Initially these were militias in support of British regulars , but when military support for the colonies ended in 1870 , the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities . The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia , paid citizen soldiers , and a small permanent component . They were mainly infantry , cavalry and mounted infantry , and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline . Even after significant reforms in the 1870s \u2014 including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units \u2014 they remained too small and unbalanced to be considered armies in the modern sense . By 1885 , the forces numbered 21 @,@ 000 men .

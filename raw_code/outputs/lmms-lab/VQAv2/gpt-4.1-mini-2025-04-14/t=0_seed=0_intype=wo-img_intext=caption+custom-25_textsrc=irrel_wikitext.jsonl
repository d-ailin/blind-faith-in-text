K 'inich Yax K 'uk ' Mo ' arrived in Cop\u00e1n in December 426 and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at Tikal . An individual known as Ajaw K 'uk ' Mo ' ( lord K 'uk ' Mo ' ) is referred to in an early text at Tikal and may well be the same person . His tomb had Teotihuacan characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior garb of Teotihuacan .

At the same time , in late 426 , Cop\u00e1n founded the nearby site of Quirigu\u00e1 , possibly sponsored by Tikal itself .

The Mongols continued to occupy northern Burma to Tagaung as the province of Zhengmian ( Cheng @-@ Mien ) but ended the fictional central Burma province of Mianzhong on 18 August 1290 . Meanwhile , the power struggle in central Burma continued with the three brothers blatantly consolidating support . To check their rising power , Kyawswa submitted to the Mongols in January 1297 , and was recognized by the Yuan emperor Tem\u00fcr Khan as King of Pagan on 20 March 1297 . The emperor also gave Chinese titles to the brothers as subordinates of Kyawswa . The brothers resented the new arrangement as it directly reduced their power . On 17 December 1297 , the three brothers overthrew Kyawswa , and founded the Myinsaing Kingdom . The dethronement forced the Mongol government to intervene again , leading to the second Mongol invasion of Burma ( 1300 \u2013 01 ) . The invasion failed . Two years later , on 4 April 1303 , the Mongols abolished the province of Zhengmian ( Cheng @-@ Mien ) , evacuated Tagaung , and returned to Yunnan . \n\n----------\nWhat this picture taken indoors?

Spain had transformed from an ally of Great Britain in the War of the First Coalition into an enemy in 1796 . Thus the presence of a powerful Spanish squadron at Manila posed a threat to the China Fleet , an annual convoy of East Indiaman merchant ships from Macau in Qing Dynasty China to Britain , which was of vital economic importance to Britain . So severe was this threat that a major invasion of the Spanish Philippines had been planned from British India during 1797 , but had been called off following the Treaty of Campo Formio in Europe and the possibility of a major war in India between the British East India Company and the Kingdom of Mysore . \n\n----------\nIs the man playing soccer on the grass or in the street?

With such strong support the Japanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the 24th Infantry Battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the Hongorai , for just one man wounded . Further progress was made over the next week , but on 4 May the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun , mines and other improvised explosive devices . After this , the 15th Brigade 's engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the Japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the Australian armour , to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the Australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines . The Japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also . To negate the effectiveness of the Australian tanks , the Japanese began to position themselves off the roads , forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support . Additionally , the Japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry , which they kept under constant observation and fire . \n\n----------\nWhat # is the bike?

These views found support in the influential New South Wales Commandant , Major General Edward Hutton , however suspicions held by the smaller colonies towards New South Wales and Victoria stifled the proposal .
